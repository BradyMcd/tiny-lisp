*A teensy little Lisp

Inspired by the Lisp seen [here](www.buildyourownlisp.com/). Rather than the top-down type approach taken in the source material my Lisp is being built bottom up which means the memory module was the first thing to be designed. And currently that's all that is anywhere near complete.

*Goals

The goal isn't necessarily to create a REPL, but rather to make an easily embeddable Lisp interpreter for use in larger programs to do things C normally wouldn't pull of comfortably.
